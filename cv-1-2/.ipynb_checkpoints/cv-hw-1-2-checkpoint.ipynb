    "*The highlighted squares are the pixels used in the corner detection. The pixel at p is the center of a candidate corner. The arc is indicated by the dashed line passes through 12 contiguous pixels which are brighter than p by more than the threshold.*\n",

    "- Select a pixel **p** which is a point of interest in the image. The intensity of **p** is denoted as **Ip**.\n",
    "- Select threshold value **t**. This value is used to detect the contiguous pixels, that are brighter that **p** by value **t**\n",
    "- Concider a circle of 16 pixels around the interest pixel **p**. The circle is drawn with the **Midpoint circle algorithm** as it is **Bresenham circle**. \n",
    "- The pixel **p** is concidered a corner if there is a set of **n** contiguous pixels in the circle of 16 pixels (previous step) which are all brighter than the value **Ip + t** or darker than **Ip - t**\n",
    "- We first check pixels 1,5,9,13 in the image above with the **Ip** value. \n",
    "- If at least three of the four-pixel values are not **above or below Ip + t**, then p is not an interest point (corner). In this case **reject the pixel p as a possible interest point.**\n",

    "*This algorithm draws all eight octants simultaneously, starting from each cardinal direction (0°, 90°, 180°, 270°) and extends both ways to reach the nearest multiple of 45° (45°, 135°, 225°, 315°). It can determine where to stop because when y = x, it has reached 45°. The reason for using these angles is shown in the above picture: As y increases, it does not skip nor repeat any y value until reaching 45°. So during the while loop, y increments by 1 each iteration, and x decrements by 1 on occasion, never exceeding 1 in one iteration. This changes at 45° because that is the point where the tangent is rise=run. Whereas rise>run before and rise<run after.*\n",
    "\n",
    "*The second part of the problem, the determinant, is far trickier. This determines when to decrement x. It usually comes after drawing the pixels in each iteration, because it never goes below the radius on the first pixel. Because in a continuous function, the function for a sphere is the function for a circle with the radius dependent on z (or whatever the third variable is), it stands to reason that the algorithm for a discrete(voxel) sphere would also rely on this Midpoint circle algorithm. But when looking at a sphere, the integer radius of some adjacent circles is the same, but it is not expected to have the same exact circle adjacent to itself in the same hemisphere. Instead, a circle of the same radius needs a different determinant, to allow the curve to come in slightly closer to the center or extend out farther.*"
