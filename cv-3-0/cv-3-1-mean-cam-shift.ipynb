    "**How to reproduce:**\n",
    "- Download video file or sequence of frames (packed in folder)\n",
    "- If you have a video file that is in the same folder as the script just follow the instructions above \n",
    "- If you have a sequence of frames in the folder you should ensure that all frame image files follow the same image convention (for ex. 0001.jpg, 0002.jpg, ..., 1001.jpg).\n",
    "- If your frame files follow the same convention you must pass an argument to the script with rejex. For the example from previous item you should use something like *\"folder_name/%0**4**d.jpg\"*, which shows that your files have **4** characters in name that are changing integers (the dataset linked at the beginning of notebook uses exactly this name convention).\n",
